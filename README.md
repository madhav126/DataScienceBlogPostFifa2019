 The dataset chosen is FIFA 19 and we will be trying to answer the following questions:
 
1) The ratio of total wage for all the players to the potential of each club and which clubs offer the least wage to players?
2) The age distribution of soccer players and their ratings compared against age.
3) Is there a relation between player's skills and their wages? Can we predict a player's potential based on their skills?


# Data Description
