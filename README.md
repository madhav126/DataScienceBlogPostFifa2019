# Description

This analysis is a part of Udacity Data Science Nanodegree
 
 Goal:
 The dataset chosen is FIFA 19 and we will be trying to answer the following questions:
 
1) The ratio of total wage for all the players to the potential of each club and which clubs offer the least wage to players?
2) The age distribution of soccer players and their ratings compared against age.
3) Is there a relation between player's skills and their wages? Can we predict a player's potential based on their skills?

# Data Description

The dataset consists of the soccer player information such as age, the club they play for and different skills sets they have.

# Libraries Used:

We have used python libraries which are useful in data analysis such as numpy, pandas and scikitlearn.
Also we will use Random Forest to predict player's potentail based on the different features given in the dataset.

# Results:

Based on the analysis of the soccer player dataset, we came to know that player rating starts peaking up after the age of 20 and starts to decrease around the age of 35 due to physical restrictions experienced by the player and it is possible to predict the player's potential based on the features given in the dataset.
